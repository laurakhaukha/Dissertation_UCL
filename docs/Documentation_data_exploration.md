## Description File: 

Within the description snapshot, there is an ID column likely reflecting a unique, distinct patient and/or cases. 
The effective time column refers to the date and time of the validation of a particular term concept or code (according to the Clinical Terms Version 3 (CTV3)). 
The active  column entails information on whether a concept/case is valid or not, signified by 1 (valid) or 0 (invalid). 
The Module ID columns entail unique identifiers, specifying the source module responsible for maintaining a particular concept, description, or relationship within SNOMED CT. 
Each module represents a collection of SNOMED CT components, such as the International Core Module, national extensions, or specialized healthcare modules. 
(A module is a collection of concepts and represents a broader medical topic, entailing more specific subtopics called concepts.) 
The Concept ID column consists of unique numeric identifiers assigned to individual clinical concepts within SNOMED CT.
Each Concept ID represents a distinct medical entity, such as a disease, procedure, anatomical structure, or clinical finding. 
The Type ID column  defines the specific category of either a relationship or description used within SNOMED CT.
Hereby, mainly offering insights into whether the associated data represents a relationship or a description type, notably encoding specific languages. 
The language code column describes the language in which the information is given. The term is a readable description of the medical concept provided in SNOMED CT. 
The caseSignificanceId  column specifies whether letter case matters for a term (column) in SNOMED CT, for instance ‘Hypertension’ or ‘hyepertension’.

## Relationship File:

Similar to the description file, the relationship file entails id, effectiveTime, active, moduleId, and typeId columns that presumably encode similar information to those in the description file. 
Unlike the description file, the relationship file entails the source and destination ID  columns, which describe the different relationships/stages between concepts in SNOMED CT.
 With the source ID reflecting the starting concept while the destination ID reflecting the target concept. 
The relationshipGroup column   (binary number)  describes the grouping of multiple relationships, collectively defining a concept. (0: non-grouped relationship; 1: grouped relationship). 
If the relationshipgroup is 1, it indicates multiple attributes (columns) such as sourc ID, relationshiptype, and destination ID must be interpreted together to enable inference and maintain clinical meaning.
The characteristicTypeId column defines the type of relationship a concept has within SNOMED CT, distinguishing whether it is a defining, additional, or historical relationship.
While the modifierId column entails unique identifiers that determine whether a relationship in SNOMED CT is existential (definite) or universal (general). 
This distinction aids in the inference of whether a relationship applies in all cases or only some cases, ensuring precise interpretation of clinical relationships.
