HELO WORLD. 

This is file is for learning puproses. At thte bottom I have instructions of how to use nano, 
which I can refer back to at any point.

- The command I entered was: nano ReadmeLaura.md 
- Git does not save the version of files by default, git only saves the version of files that it tracks.
